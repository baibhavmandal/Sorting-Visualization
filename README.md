# Data Structure Visualize

Welcome to **Data Structure Visualize**, a project dedicated to visualizing various algorithms, particularly sorting algorithms. The goal of this project is to help users better understand how different algorithms work by providing a visual representation of their processes.

### Key Sections:

- **Project Overview**: Describes the purpose and goals of the project.
- **Current Visualizations**: Details the algorithms that have been visualized so far.
- **Future Plans**: Lists future enhancements and algorithms that will be added.
- **Getting Started**: Provides instructions on how to clone and run the project locally.
- **Contributing**: Encourages contributions and provides guidelines for contributing.
- **Contact**: Standard sections for open-source projects.

## Project Overview

In this project, I aim to create a platform where various algorithms can be visualized step-by-step, allowing users to see how data is manipulated and sorted in real-time. The visualizations are designed to be intuitive and informative, providing clear insights into the inner workings of each algorithm.

## Current Visualizations

### 1. Insertion Sort

- **Description**: Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort.
- **Visualization**: Watch as the algorithm iteratively builds a sorted portion of the array, inserting each new element into its correct position.

### 2. Quick Sort

- **Description**: Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning an array into sub-arrays. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
- **Visualization**: See how the algorithm divides the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorting them individually and then combining them to form a fully sorted array.

### 3. Selection Sort

- **Description**: Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest, depending on the order) element from the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
- **Visualization**: Follow the algorithm as it systematically finds the smallest element and places it in the correct position, reducing the unsorted portion of the array step-by-step.

## Future Plans

This project is a work in progress, and I am constantly updating it with new features and visualizations. Here are some of the upcoming visualizations that I plan to add:

- **Merge Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Graph Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS)**
- **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to enhance this project with additional algorithm visualizations!
